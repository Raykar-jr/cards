## About
Flashcards for online training using the question-answer system with the ability to create your own training modules (card decks), as well as their expansion (creating new cards), editing and privacy settings. The project also implemented a learning process with a rating system for assessing the knowledge of the material covered and a counter for passing training cards. The project has the ability to search for educational cards, as well as two-level filtering.
